For instance, if you zoom in you might want to show details that you would otherwise be hidden. So the map really adapts to where you look on the Earth. The downside of dynamic maps is that you will see more flickering as you interact with the map, because tiles have to be refreshed as soon as you drag or zoom.\n",
